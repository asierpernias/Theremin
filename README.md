# LOOM — Gestural Theremin and Mini-DAW

Loom transforms any webcam into a complete music controller: move your hand, change the instrument, and control the volume in real time. Every performance can be recorded directly into a multi-track editor with real DAW tools.

## How does it work

1. The camera detects your hand with `HandLandmarker` from MediaPipe — 21 landmarks of reference per hand.
2. The position of the wrist and the number of extended fingers determine which instrument, pitch, and volume are played.
3. Tone.js synthesizes the audio with reverb and delay, both controllable from the UI.
4. Every note can be recorded. Click REC, play, then click STOP. The result appears on the Timeline, with its waveform, ready to be moved, cut, faded, duplicated, or exported.

## UI

The app is designed as a workspace of floating windows (draggable, minimizable, and adjustable in width/height), instead of a fixed layout — so every user can set up their own preferred way of working.

- **Camera** — live feed with the hand skeleton overlay
- **Theremin Controls** — reverb, delay, octave, and the REC button
- **Tracks** — list of tracks with solo/mute/arm/volume
- **Transport** — playback, BPM
- **Sequencer** — build your own rhythms from simple samples

## Features

- Recording performance → clip on the Timeline with offline render
- Complete Timeline: move, cut, trim, duplicate, fade in/out, per-clip volume, multi-selection via drag, context menu
- Configurable snap (1/4, 1/8, 1/16, free)
- Undo/Redo (command pattern) — `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`
- Export to WAV / MIDI / MP3

- Visual indicator of active recording
- Mute / solo / arm for each track
- Available as a web app and as a desktop app (Windows, via Tauri)
